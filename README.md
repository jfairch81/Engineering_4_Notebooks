## Hello World

### Description & Lesson Learned
Creating this and logging into the pi was not very hard except my pi wouldn't connect to my mac for some reason. it took me 2 days to do it but eventually with some help from Dr. Shields I got it. I was having lots of trouble but I used to have a raspberry pi so some of the syntax isn't that hard for me to understand.

## Get Your Pi Online

### Description & Lesson Learned
This one was harder than the last one, not because I couldn't get it online, but because I messed up and accidentally cloned my github repo inside of my github repo. This provided problems for me, but once Dr. Shields helped me with the delete message, it was smooth sailing from there. I think this shows how one small thing can mess you up, and you have to work backwards from there. In code this happens a lot and this was my first such instance this year.

## Hello Python

### Description & Lesson Learned
This one wasn't very hard, I just had to remember how to commit the dice_roller.py to my GitHub which means I had to watch the pi online video again. The while loop wasn't very challenging, the only thing is I am not that used to booleans but they don't seem to hard to use. For the future, I need to remember how to commit things to my GitHub, and one annoying thing is if you have a syntax error, it only tells you 1 line at a time, so you have to continually go back.
